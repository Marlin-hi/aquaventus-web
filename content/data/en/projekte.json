      "beschreibung": "AquaDuctus is the central infrastructure project of AquaVentus: a hydrogen pipeline from the offshore production sites in the North Sea to the mainland. As the only pipeline project for the German North Sea within the hydrogen core network, AquaDuctus connects offshore production with onshore demand centres — industry, storage facilities, and the European hydrogen core network.",
      "details": "On 22 October 2024, AquaDuctus was approved by the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) as part of the hydrogen core network. The project is IPCEI-notified and holds PCI status (Project of Common Interest) from the European Union. Via the European Hydrogen Backbone, connection options exist to the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Norway.",
